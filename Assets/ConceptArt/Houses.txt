House 1
    Idea: Easy tutorial house to teach player mechanics(what are the mechanics?)
    Theme: Not so spooky halloween things such as
        pumpkins
        not spooky ghosts
        bats
    Design:
        This one will not be haunted, some rich person's house that created a spooky house with electronic halloween stuff
        Pushing hidden button to open a door or something

House 2:
    Idea: Now that theyre familiar, test their skills with mid puzzles and gameplay
    Theme: 
        Another not hanted house, this timie with a goofy witch animatronic 
    Design:
        Getting 3 potions for the witch that wil let you get past the main door
        Player will probably find each potion in rooms with spooky stuff in them

House 3:
    Idea: The kids now want a real challenge and dare the main character to go to an abandoned house that rumors say is haunted
    Theme:
        First abandoned house where spooky stuff will happen, this one's theme are Ghosts
    Design:
        Small-ish house with an overgrown frontyard
        Characted will need to enter from backyard where they will need to find a way inside the house
        Once inside they will begin to notice paranormal stuff

House 4:
    Idea: Stuff is going to start getting dangerous, first house where kids will run to mother if they get too spooked 
    Theme:
        A graveyard, skeletons, zombies
    Design:
        The gate where the main character entered will suspiciously close, now he will need to find the key by checking out different places in the graveyard

House 5(Last house?):
    Idea: Final house will be a mansion with all sorts of halloween stuff happening in there, mansion is 'inspired' by the iSpy book
    Theme:
        Everything halloween
    Design:
        Mansion will have
            front area with giant fountain 
            back area with a maze thingy
